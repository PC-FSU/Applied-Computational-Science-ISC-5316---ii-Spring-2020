I have included the main.cpp which contain the c++ code for this lab, also i have included
the python notebook which is used to plot the graphs.

I am also including the file of DFT value and inverse DFT values for 16,32,64(16.txt,32.txt,64.txt) cases of first problem.
Simlarly for second problem i have attached problem_2_a.txt, and problem_2_b.txt.
